# API Design

## Summary

This document explains and memorializes the API design decisions ember-keyboard has made, for the benefit of consumers of the addon as well as contributors.

## Motivation

In April of 2020, @optikalefx opened PR #117 to fix a bug related to Alt key combos on Macs and software key remapping. The ensuing discussion and research led to a deeper understanding of the `code` and `key` properties of keyboard events in modern browsers. The group became convinced that ember-keyboard's previous blended approach to using the `code` and `key` properties was a mistake and set out to design a clearer API that is more consistent with the web platform.

## Background

The web platform's handling of keyboard events has a messy history, with several now-deprecated properties, including `char`, `charCode`, `which` and `keyCode`, and a now-deprecated event `keypress`

The current supported events are `keydown` and `keyup`, each with a consistent set of supported properties, including two we'll need to understand in detail for this document: `key` and `code`.

The `key` attribute is intended for users who are interested in the meaning of the key being pressed, taking into account the current keyboard layout, and any software remapping the end-user may have in effect.

The `code` attribute is intended for users who are interested in the key that was pressed by the user, without any layout modifications applied. Example use case: Detecting WASD keys (e.g., for movement controls in a game).

The W3C UI Events spec includes instructive [examples of `code` and `key` values for various user actions on various keyboard layouts](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#code-examples). They are well worth reviewing.

## Principles

For keyboard shortcuts that are based on physical location on the keyboard (e.g. `WASD` game or cursor controls), the `code` property should be used. For mnemonic-based shortcuts (e.g. `Ctrl+B` to Bold text), the `key` property should be used. ember-keyboard should provide an API to make both of these possible.

By making providing clear semantics about whether a keyboard event handler is using `code` or `key`, we can avoid a class of bugs and confusion that were present in previous versions of ember-keyboard.

## Detailed design

Concepts:

* Infer `key` vs `code` mode. e.g. `alt+c` means `key` mode, `alt+KeyC` means `code` mode
* default to listening on `keydown`, allow specifying to listen on other valid event names
* generally try to match ember's `{{on ...}}` modifier semantics, to make usage intuitive

#### on-key helper

Replaces the `keyboard-press` component in 6.0.0-beta.0. Since nothing is output, a
helper is more appropriate than a component.

```hbs
<!-- Fires `doThing` on keydown of the key that generates "c" on their computer
     while Alt is pressed -->

{{on-key "alt+c" this.doThing}}

<!-- Fires `doThing` on KEYUP of the key that generates "c" on their computer
     while Alt is pressed -->

{{on-key "alt+c" this.doThing event="keyup"}}

<!-- Fires `doThing` on keydown of the key that generates "c" on their computer
     while Alt is pressed, or on keydown of the key that generates "t" while
     Ctrl and Shift are pressed (i.e. no API support for binding multiple keys,
     just include on-key twice) -->

{{on-key "alt+c" this.doThing}}
{{on-key "ctrl+shift+t" this.doThing}}

<!-- Fires `doThing` on keydown of the key at the standard position of the C key
     while Alt is pressed. This is inferred from the use of "KeyC" rather than "c" -->

{{on-key "alt+KeyC" this.doThing}}

<!-- Fires `doThing` on keyup of the key at the standard position of the C key
     while Alt is pressed -->

{{on-key "alt+KeyC" this.doThing event="keyup"}}
```

In all these cases, the keyboard event is passed to the action so that you could
consult it or call `preventDefault`.

#### on-key element modifier

Uses the same signature as the `on-key` helper.

```hbs
<!-- When used with a form element input, textarea, or select, the action fires only
     when element has focus: -->

<input type='text' {{on-key "alt+c" this.doThing}}> <!-- `key` mode -->
<input type='text' {{on-key "alt+c" this.doThing event="keyup"}}> <!-- `key` mode -->
<input type='text' {{on-key "alt+KeyC" this.doThing}}> <!-- `code` mode -->
<input type='text' {{on-key "alt+KeyC" this.doThing event="keyup"}}> <!-- `code` mode -->

<!-- When used with another element type and leaving off the action, it will trigger a
     `click` on the element if no action is passed. This allows for easy declaration of
     keyboard shortcuts for anything clickable: -->

<button {{on-key "alt+c"}}></button> <!-- `key` mode -->
<button {{on-key "alt+c" event="keyup"}}></button> <!-- `key` mode -->
<button {{on-key "alt+KeyC"}}></button> <!-- `code` mode -->
<button {{on-key "alt+KeyC" event="keyup"}}></button> <!-- `code` mode -->
```

One thing to note is that the original keyboard event is not passed to the action
handler when leaving off the action to trigger the click event.

#### Setting up handlers in Javascript

Decorator usage:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';
import { onKey } from 'ember-keyboard';

export default class Foo extends Component {
  //...

  @onKey('alt+c') // `key` mode
  doSomethingA() { ... }

  @onKey('alt+c', { event: 'keyup' }) // `key` mode
  doSomethingB() { ... }

  @onKey('alt+c') // Binding multiple combos. This one is `key` mode...
  @onKey('ctrl+shift+KeyT') // ...and this one is `code` mode
  doSomethingC() { ... }

  @onKeyboard('alt+KeyC') // `code` mode
  doSomethingD() { ... }

  //...
}
```

Non-decorator usage:

```js
import { onKey } from 'ember-keyboard';

export default Component.extends({
  //...
  doSomethingA: onKey('alt+c', function() { ... }), // `key` mode
  doSomethingB: onKey('alt+c', { event: 'keyup' }, function() { ... }), // `key` mode
  doSomethingC: onKey('alt+c', onKey('ctrl+shift+t', function() { ... })), // Binding multiple combos
  doSomethingD: onKey('alt+KeyC', function() { ... }) // `code` mode
  //...
});
```

### Low-level key-combo matching API

A low-level API for the matching engine that determines whether a particular keyboard event is considered to match a specified key-combo will also be exposed.

It will be available as an `if-key` helper:

```hbs
{{!-- attach your own event handler using the {{on}} modifier --}}

<div {{on "keydown" (if-key "alt+c" this.doThing)}}></div>

{{!-- combining with the ember-on-helper addon --}}

{{on-document "keydown" (if-key "alt+KeyX" this.doThing)}}

{{!-- use some third-party component API --}}

<SomeComponent @onKey={{if-key "alt+x" this.doThing}}/>
```

It will also be available as an `isKey` JS function:

```js
import { isKey } from 'ember-keyboard';

function onEvent(e) {
  if (isKey(e, 'alt+x')) {
    this.handleAltX();
  }
}
```

## Alternatives

One idea is to back ember-keyboard by a widely used Javascript keyboard handling library. @lukemelia looked into mousetrap and keymaster to see how they handled key vs code and whether we could/should use them. In both cases, he found that they rely on now-deprecated keyboard event properties (`which` and `keyCode`). e.g. ccampbell/mousetrap#474. For that reason, his conclusion is that taking a dependency on one of them is not a good idea.

### Does ember-keyboard bring an opinion about whether most developers should be using `code` or `key`-based shortcuts for common types of apps targeted by Ember?

No, it is agnostic.

### Challenges with mapping `key` values

Because `key` is the generated value including the effect of modifiers, `Shift+2` has a key value of `@` on common English layouts. Should a keyboard shortcut of `key='@'` be equivalent to one of `modifier='Shift' key='2'`? If so, how do we encode the mapping of `@` to `2` necessary to support the latter? *This remains an open question.*

Alt-key combos on OS X bring a similar set of challenges. `Alt+c` on OS X has a `key` value of `รง` since that is the character normally generated on Macs when pressing Alt/Option and C together. To support `modifier='Alt' key='c'` on Macs, we would need to map `รง` back to `c` somehow.

### How do these API changes the priority and propagation features of ember-keyboard, if at all?

No need for this functionality to change. The helpers, modifiers and functions shown above will all allow for priority and/or propagation to be set.

### What about key sequences, a la gmail's `g` followed by `i` to go to the inbox?

Out of scope for now, but this API could be readily enhanced to support key sequences in a future release.

### This would be a whole new API from version 5. What is the migration path? Is a codemod possible?

The issue that prompted this API rethink was that the addon was conceptually mixing `key` and `code` in a confusing and inconsistent way, so the existing behavior is not something that we would want to bring forward. It seems, therefore, that a codemod would be inadvisable since we would not be preserving behavior. Is should be possible to leave the existing API in place with the existing behavior and deprecate it. This would allow people to upgrade and incrementally move to the new API. The deprecated API could then be dropped in the next major release.
