## Mixins

To reduce boilerplate, `ember-keyboard` includes several mixins with common patterns.

**Note: these are used alongside `EKMixin`, it must be included as well for these to work.**

### EKOnInsertMixin

```js
import { EKOnInsertMixin } from 'ember-keyboard';
```

This mixin will activate the component on `didInsertElement`, and as per normal, it will deactivate on `willDestroyElement`.

### EKOnInitMixin

```js
import { EKOnInitMixin } from 'ember-keyboard';
```

This mixin will activate the controller on `init`.

### EKOnFocusMixin

```js
import { EKOnFocusMixin } from 'ember-keyboard';
```

This mixin will activate the component whenever it receives focus and deactivate it when it loses focus.

### EKFirstResponderOnFocusMixin

```js
import { EKFirstResponderOnFocusMixin } from 'ember-keyboard';
```

This mixin grants the component first responder status while it is focused. When it loses focus, it resigns its status.

Note that it will also activate the component on focus in, though it does not deactivate the component on focus out.
