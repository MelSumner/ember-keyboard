## Installation

```sh
ember install ember-keyboard
```

## Overview

`ember-keyboard` is a KeyboardEvent manager for Ember.js. It provides a simple API for responding to key events based on the [code property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/code), and it automatically applies a polyfill for browsers that do not yet support it.

For more complex scenarios, `ember-keyboard` also offers an API for managing which components and routes respond to key events, allowing you to control for application states such as modals and loading screens.
